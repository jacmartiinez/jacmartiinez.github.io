    <p>Macro photography (or photomacrography or macrography, and sometimes macrophotography) is extreme close-up photography, usually of
      very small subjects and living organisms like insects, in which the size of the subject in the
      photograph is greater than life size (though macrophotography also refers to the art of making very large photographs). By the original
      definition, a macro photograph is one in which the size of the subject on the negative or image sensor
      is life size or greater. In some senses, however, it refers to a finished photograph of a subject that is greater than life size.</p>
    <br>
    <p>"Macro" lenses specifically designed for close-up work, with a long barrel for close focusing and optimized for high reproduction ratios,
      are one of the most common tools for macro photography. (Unlike most other lens makers, Nikon designates its macro lenses as "Micro" because
      of their original use in making microform.) Most modern macro lenses can focus continuously to infinity as well and can provide excellent
      optical quality for normal photography. True macro lenses, such as the Canon MP-E 65 mm f/2.8 1-5x Macro or Minolta AF 3x-1x 1.7-2.8 Macro,
      can achieve higher magnification than life size, enabling photography of the structure of small insect eyes, snowflakes, and other minuscule
      objects. Others, such as the Infinity Photo-Optical's TS-160 can achieve magnifications from 0-18x on sensor, focusing from infinity down to
      18 mm from the object.</p><br>

      <p>Ordinary lenses can be used for macro photography by using a "reversing ring". This ring attaches to the filter thread on the front of a
        lens and makes it possible to attach the lens in reverse. Excellent quality results up to 4x life-size magnification are possible.
        For cameras with all-electronic communications between the lens and the camera body specialty reversing rings are available which preserve
        these communications. When used with extension tubes or bellows, a highly versatile, true macro (greater than life size) system can be assembled.
        Since non-macro lenses are optimized for small reproduction ratios, reversing the lens allows it to be used for reciprocally high ratios.</p>
