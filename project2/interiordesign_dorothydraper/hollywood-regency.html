    <h1>Hollywood Regency</h1>
    <p>Hollywood Regency is a beautiful and elegant style, sometimes referred too as
        Regency Moderne and Modern Baroque born around the 1920's to 1960's. Drorothy Draper was the
          first inteior designer in using Modern Baroque. Her interiors were characterized by "splashy"
          colors in never-before-seen combinations – “dull” white and “shiny” black. Her signature “cabbage rose”
          chintz, paired with bold stripes; her elaborate and ornate plaster designs and moldings – over doors, on
          walls and ceilings; her black and white checkered floors (The Quitandinah Palace & Casino Resort, Petropolis,
          Brazil); her massive, paneled, lacquered doors (Arrowhead Springs Hotel, California), some framed with bolection
          (Hampshire House, New York) or with elaborate plaster or intricate mirror frames (Camellia House, Drake Hotel, Chicago)
          – all contributed to dramatic design often referred to as “the Draper touch”.
