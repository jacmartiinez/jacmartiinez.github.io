    <p>1. Brazilliance Wallpaper. This bold, original iconic design by Dorothy Draper will add a touch of the tropics to your city home while you dream of the islands.
      <br><br>2. The Metropolitan Museum of Art Restaurant. Dororthy Draper designed the restaurant housed in the Lamont Wing's Roman courtyard which was finished in late 1953.
                The restaurant provided visitors with an inviting and cheerful little reception room, apple green and various shades of coral and lemon yellow along with <thead>
                leather upholstery of the Chippendale chairs and a pool as the centerpiece with the work of Swedish sculptor Carl Milles, titled <em>The Fountain of the Muses</em>
                which now resides in a sculpture garden located in Murrells Inlet, South Carolina.
        <br><br>3. Camellia House Restaurant, Drake Hotel. Dorothy Draper installed garden furniture in the lounge, creating an outside-inside sense of space. She designed everything
               from the carpets and light fixtures to furniture, china and mirrors, right down to matchbook covers and the swizzle sticks in the form of a camellia flower with stem.
