      <h1>Dorothy Draper</h1>
      <p>Dorothy Draper was born to a wealthy and privileged family in 1889,
        in one of the most exclusive communities in American history, Tuxedo Park.
        She was the first to “professionalize” the interior design industry by establishing, in 1923, the
        first interior design company in the United States, Dorothy Draper & Company, something that until
        then was unheard of, and also at a time when it was considered daring for a woman to go into business for herself.
